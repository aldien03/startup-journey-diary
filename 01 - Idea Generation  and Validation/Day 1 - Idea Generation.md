# Day1 - Idea Generation 

<br>

First of all, I was clueless, have no business idea and even didn't know how to generate ideas. So, I have to do research on how to generate ideas.

I have some questions in mind which are:
* Which place or school that having success rate of facilitating startup on the world?
* How could I learn from them?
* Which idea has higher success rate in the business landscape?

That's lead me to find Y-Combinator and Stanford University, which has higher success rate of alumnae to build start up. 

https://www.ycombinator.com/library/8g-how-to-get-startup-ideas gave me some insights which is the best startup ideas rooted to founder/market fit has success rate better than any ideas generation method. 

When the founder are an expert on the field, they know the gap of unserved market and know how to solved the problem.

They have given me several questions to trace back on my experience:
* What unique skills you learned?
Short answers are troubleshooting and debugging software, managing people through data and thorough plan, quick learner, and automating boring stuffs.

* What did you develop in-house?
Initial automation script to download and process files. Excel macro to automate boring job.

Then I took Strength Finder Test, Talent Dynamics Test and Stifin. Why? Because I really want to know my strength, inner character and how to find best fit to the startup ideas.

It turns out like this.
- Strengths: Intellection, Analytical, Input, Learner, Strategic, Focus and Connectedness as seven strongest strengths
- WD Profile: Accummulator
- Stifin: Sensing Introvert

Then I try to populate the keyword for each profiles and summed up like below:
- Data and Fact
- Research
- Analytical
- Data and Information Collection
- Data Driven Decison Making
- Persistent and Workaholic
- Strategic

### That is a typical Data Scientist characteristic? Then what is Data Science do?
They collecting data, exploring insights, build model from data either to predict, classify or automation.

### There are many possibilities of this field?
1. Become a data scientist to a reputable company.
2. Create an online course of becoming data scientist and AI engineer.
3. Create a consulting service for building predition or classifation model.
4. Build an analytical product that generation insight report of other company doing.
5. Build an AI product from initial data.
Still unsure which path that I will choose, although 1 and 2 is a good way to start.

### Idea Validation
The problem is because this is a relatively new field, I have a gap to be called as an expert on the field (5 to 10).
How big could it be? Very big because data is a new oil! Look at Facebook, Google, Netflix and Amazon. Basically they are data company.(9 to 10)
How sure I am that this solving acute problem? Not that really sure, but if you heard Credit Scoring prediction, Product Recommendation on e-commerce, Automatic Driving Car, Business Time-Series Forecating, Political Decision etc. It could be big, but the basis of the product is data. No data means no insight, no model and got nothing. It has to start from somewhere else.(7 to 10)
Have a new insight? No, not yet. (2 to 10)

In overall it has score 5.75. Not bad as a starting point.

To increase the score, I need to be a practical expert and hopefully get a new insights.

So, what is the current gap?
- I don't know the best way to collect data
- I don't have any experience on building data warehouse and data pipeline
- I don't have any idea to choose which fields that I'm going to be an expert? Computer Vision, NLP or Else

Definitely, I need to learn further more and will take this path:
- Google IT Automation with Python.
- Data Engineering with Google Cloud.
- IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate
- IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
- Advanced Data Science with IBM Specialization.
- IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate.
- IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate.
- DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate
- TensorFlow: Data and Deployment Specialization
- TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization

Thanks and See you on the other side.
