# Startup Journey Diary

<br>

Hi, I am Aldien.

I love learning and feel growth on the daily basis. That is why I love to collecting knowledges either from school or courses. But, it has no real outcome except unused knowledge.

It has feeling like drinking sea water. More knowledge that I learnt, and more thirsty I am of studying more knowledge. Before ever applying the knowledge to solve a real world problem.

My current goal is to build an application, started from ideas generation, validation, until production.

The approach will be on-demand learning, based on the progress and problems found on the related stage.
